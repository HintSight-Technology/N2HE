# P2N3 (Privacy-Preserving Neural Network of NTU)
## Introduction
P2N3 (Privacy-Preserving Neural Network of NTU) is a C++ open-source library which implements an optimized fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme for privacy-preserving neural networks.  
Our optimized FHE scheme enables us the ability to perform weighted sums and convolutions on the approximate LWE-based additive homomorphic encryption scheme, and to evaluate non-polynomial activations on FHEW ciphertexts. This FHE scheme has the following properties: 
- It can be applied to neural networks of arbitrary depth.
- It supports many kinds of widely used activations, such as the most popular ReLU. 
- When applied to inference of privacy-preserving neural networks, it is fast and accurate.

It is the implementation of publication [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398424). For its application in other fields such as pandemic modelling, please refer to [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376224).

## Prerequisites
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

## Installation
Supported platforms: Linux and MacOS.  

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This library uses third-party codes: 
- [FasterNTT](https://github.com/nict-sfl/FasterNTT), a very fast and advanced library for polynomial multiplication based on Number-theoretic Transform (NTT). 
- The randomness is based on the [LAC algorithm](https://github.com/pqc-lac/lac-intel64).

Please refer to [P2N3_Programmer_Guide.pdf](https://github.com/HintSight-Technology/P2N3/blob/main/P2N3_Programmer_Guide.pdf) in this repo. 

## Examples
We offer some applications of our FHE scheme. It includes inference on MNIST dataset, facial recognition, speaker verification, text classification and object classification.   
REMARK: All the image/audio data are stored in the form of extracted feature vector (in plaintext). Please refer to the detailed experiments in our publication [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10398424).
